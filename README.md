# 🚗 Used Cars Price Analysis (EDA Project)
# 📌 Overview

This project explores the Used Cars dataset (CarsDekho) to uncover insights about car resale pricing trends in India. The goal is to perform end-to-end data analysis — from cleaning and preprocessing raw data to conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizing key patterns.

The project demonstrates skills in Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and follows a structured data lifecycle approach.

# 🔑 Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and converting data types.

Extract meaningful features such as brand names from car models.

Perform EDA to identify trends, anomalies, and correlations between car attributes and prices.

Visualize key findings using plots and graphs.

Provide actionable insights into how specifications (mileage, engine size, fuel type, ownership) influence resale value.

# 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Cleaning & Analysis)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)

# 📊 Key Insights

Car brand, fuel type, engine capacity, and mileage strongly influence resale prices.

Diesel cars tend to retain higher resale value over longer usage compared to petrol.

First-owner cars are priced significantly higher than second or third-owner cars.

Visualization of data highlights clear pricing patterns across brands and vehicle types.
